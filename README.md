# Developer comments

I decided to go for the slideshow option, since the instructions and materials were clearer. However, during the writing of the solution I struggled with CSS-first approach, spending most of my time on the styling. In the end I opted for a non-CSS ring for the score percentage/process. I did not have the time to add tests or make the mobile design. Due to the inability to register an account on the ClearScore website, I did not have a reference for other slides, so I guessed. Due to the lack of Internet access I got delayed as well.
In short, this is not my proudest nor prettiest work, but what I could do within 3 hours.

# Tech-screen

This repo contains multiple apps.  The concept is to enable developers to pick and choose which tech problem(s) they would like to solve.

But first, a little bit about us...
